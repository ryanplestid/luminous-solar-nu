This folder contains 3 Mathematica notebooks, and 5 Subdirectories.
### Notebooks 


1) Limit-Setting.nb

   This notebook makes the tau-exclusion limit, and calculates the exclusion
   curve. 

2) Solar-Neutrino-Fluxes-MassMixing,nb

   This produces plots of relevant fluxes 

3) Benchmark-values.nb

   This just calculates some benchmark values of e.g. decay length, mixing
   angles etc.


### Directories


1) Existing constraints

   Constraints  on HNLs are here includiing BBN for tau

2) N-Spec

   HNL fluxes are stored here. 

3) PDFs

   Figures are stored here 

4) Survival probabilities

   For electron neutrrino transiting from sun to earth. 

5) SolarNuFlux

   Solar neutrino flux components
